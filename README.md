# Welcome to The Brothers Brambi official group page!

Our Mission is to create the next big team to rival the greatest. We plan to do this by fostering a community of sportsmanship,
competency, and lighthearted glory. If you are looking for a community to join like this - read on!

We and the Brothers salute you for your interest in joining our emerging and competetive ESports team.

Here are the community guidelines we have set forth (for both prospective Brothers and fans alike).

1. No slander of another Brother or fan.
2. Absolutely no toxic behavior directed towards other teams as we win or lose. We value sportsmanship highly.
3. Enjoy your time with us. Its all about the game ;)


*Lighthearted Glory is the motto - if you stick to that you wont be lead astray.*
